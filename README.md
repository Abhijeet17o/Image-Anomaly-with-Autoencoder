### **Image Anomaly Detection with Autoencoder**

#### **Overview**  
This project demonstrates how to use an **autoencoder** for detecting anomalies in images. An autoencoder is an unsupervised neural network that learns to encode and reconstruct input images, making it useful for identifying outliers or anomalies.  

#### **Key Features**  
- Implements an **autoencoder** using deep learning techniques.  
- Trains on normal images and detects anomalies based on reconstruction error.  
- Uses **Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and NumPy** for model development.  
- Includes data preprocessing, training, and evaluation steps.  

#### **Requirements**  
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:  
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib opencv-python
```

#### **Usage**  
1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook** to train the autoencoder.  
2. **Provide test images** to identify anomalies based on reconstruction loss.  
3. **Visualize results** using matplotlib to compare original vs. reconstructed images.  

#### **Project Structure**  
- `image-anomaly-with-autoencoder.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with complete code and explanations.  
- `data/` → Folder containing normal and anomalous image samples (if applicable).  

#### **Results**  
- The autoencoder learns to reconstruct normal images effectively.  
- Images with anomalies exhibit **higher reconstruction error**, enabling detection.  

#### **Future Improvements**  
- Experiment with different **network architectures** (e.g., CNN-based autoencoders).  
- Apply the model to real-world datasets for **industrial anomaly detection**.  
- Fine-tune **threshold selection** for better anomaly classification.
